## Structure & Conventions — Documentation Map

<!-- Maintained automatically. The master copy lives at
     ~/.claude/structure-and-conventions.md (claude-workdocs repo) and the SessionStart
     hook ~/.claude/scripts/sync-claude-md.sh keeps this copy of the block up to date —
     edit the master, never this block. The block is committed with the repository on
     purpose: it tells anyone (human or agent) working with this repo where the
     project's documentation lives and how to read and maintain it. -->

### Where the documentation lives

- `docs/design/` — all planning and design documents:
  - `plan-NNN-<indicative-description>.md` — one file per plan.
  - `project-design.md` — the complete, always-current project design; update it with every new design or design change.
  - `project-functions.md` — the registry of all functional requirements and feature descriptions.
  - `configuration-guide.md` — the project's configuration guide, when one exists (structure below).
- `docs/reference/` — all reference material collected for the project.
- `docs/tools/<tool-name>.md` — one dedicated documentation file per project tool.
- `test_scripts/` — every test script goes here; create the folder if it doesn't exist.
- `prompts/` — every prompt created while working on the project (create the folder if missing); each file name has a sequential number prefix and describes the prompt's use and purpose.
- `Issues - Pending Items.md` (project root) — the register of every issue, pending item, inconsistency, or discrepancy detected while working on the project. Pending items come first (most critical and important on top), completed items after. Whenever a defect or issue is fixed, check this file for an item to remove.

### How to use the documentation

- Every time an issue is solved, it must be resolved AND both the issue and the solution must be thoroughly documented.
- This file's "Tools" section (when present) lists each project tool with a one-or-two-sentence description of what it is capable of and the relative path to its dedicated documentation file under `docs/tools/` — retrieve the full documentation from there whenever it is needed. Full tool documentation must never be inlined into this file.
- Before writing any code script, consult the "Tools" section and the documentation under `docs/tools/` to check whether the planned code fits the scope of an existing tool. If so, implement it as an extension of that tool; otherwise build a generic, abstract version of the code as a new tool in the project's toolset, document it under `docs/tools/`, and reference it in the "Tools" section. The goal is to progressively grow the tools needed to test, evaluate, generate data, collect information, etc., and reuse them consistently.

<configuration-guide>
- A configuration guide, when requested, is created at `docs/design/configuration-guide.md` and explains:
  - When multiple configuration options exist (config file, env variables, CLI params, etc.), what the options are and the priority of each one.
  - The purpose and use of each configuration variable.
  - How the user can obtain such a configuration variable.
  - The recommended approach for storing or managing the variable.
  - Which options exist for the variable and what each option means for the project.
  - Any default value the parameter has.
  - For configuration parameters that expire (e.g., PAT keys, tokens), propose adding a parameter that captures the expiration date, so the app or service can proactively warn users to renew.

## Tools

- **publish-article** — Publishes a self-contained HTML article (a video deep-dive snapshot) from a source file to the site's `articles/` directory byte-identically, while appending or updating an entry in `data/catalog.json` with extracted metadata (title, thumbnail, SHA-256, optional `category` placing the entry in either the "Deep Dives" or the "AI-News" homepage list). See `docs/tools/publish-article.md`.
- **publish-link** — Curates a third-party article URL into the site's `data/links.json`, extracting Open Graph / Twitter-card metadata (title, image, summary, source site) and writing a `LinkEntry` with an optional `category` that targets either the "Articles" or the "AI-News" homepage list. See `docs/tools/publish-link.md`.
- **publish-experimental-article** — Publishes a self-contained HTML article byte-identically into the `experimental/` folder and updates `data/experimental-catalog.json`. Mirrors `publish-article` but enforces a single-writer guarantee that prevents any write to `articles/` or `data/catalog.json`. Pairs with the `build:experimental` build script and the `publish-experimental.yml` GitHub Action, which together deploy the experimental sibling site to a separate, unlinked GitHub Pages repo (privacy is by unadvertised URL — no auth). See `docs/tools/publish-experimental-article.md`.

## Site lists

The home page renders three independent lists, in this fixed order:

1. **AI-News** — non-technical AI news. Mixed: catalog video entries with `category: "ai-news"` AND link entries with `category: "ai-news"`.
2. **Deep Dives** — technical AI videos. Catalog entries with the default category (`deep-dive`).
3. **Articles** — curated technical/general AI articles. Link entries with the default category (`article`).

See `docs/PUBLISHING.md` for the agent-facing publishing contract (which CLI to use, the date-priority rule, title formatting, image referencing, and the `--category` flag).

See `docs/MIGRATING-CONTENT.md` for the agent-facing contract on moving an item between Agent News (public) and Agent News Experimental in either direction — covers videos and links across all areas (AI-News, Deep Dives, Tools, Articles), the category-compatibility rules, the universal "destination-write + source-remove + verify + push" recipe, and the common pitfalls (half-migrations, `tools` being experimental-only, `publishedAt` drift, missing `publish-experimental-link` CLI).
